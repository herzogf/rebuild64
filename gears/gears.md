# Gears
The OEM gears are generally hard to fix as they're very delicate and have small details. You can try to repair your existing ones but more than likely you'll try to find (make or buy) some replacement gears.

## 3D printing new gears

3D Printing the gears is no easy task because of the delicate details and tight tolerances, especially for the gear teeth. I'm trying to compare as many "high detail" 3D printing techniques by ordering samples from different 3D printing manufacturers.

Up to now for all tests the [3D models created by eL_maN](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3053523) were used. The result is always a combination of 3D model and printing technique - the 3D models were used as-is from thingiverse, so no customization was done to adapt to the used technique. Thus please take the results from the controller/stick tests with a heavy grain of salt. My main focus was/is to find 3D printing techniques and materials that can produce the fine gear teeth correctly. After settling on some techniques + materials later we can customize the models to fit those perfectly.

The following table lists all samples as of 2021/03/24. Click on the ID to jump to the details page of the specific print. For details for the 3D printing techniques and materials see [Additive and subtractive manufacturing](../crosscutting/manufacturing.md).

Hint: This table is [best viewed directly on GitHub](https://github.com/herzogf/rebuild64/blob/main/gears/gears.md#3d-printing-new-gears).

Clarifications:
- 3D gear model "eL_maN" for type "small" (= left-right stick movement) is [assembly_-_sgear-com-true.STL](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3053523/files)
- 3D gear model "eL_maN" for type "large" (= up-down stick movemen) is [assembly_-_lgear-com-true.STL](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3053523/files)
- Sample prices are without VAT / taxes and shipping fee.
- Material naming is taken directly from the 3D printing manufacturer (e.g. from their receipt).
