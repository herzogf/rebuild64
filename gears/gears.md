# Gears
The OEM gears are generally hard to fix as they're very delicate and have small details. You can try to repair your existing ones but more than likely you'll try to find (make or buy) some replacement gears.

## 3D printing new gears

3D Printing the gears is no easy task because of the delicate details and tight tolerances, especially for the gear teeth. I'm trying to compare as many "high detail" 3D printing techniques by ordering samples from different 3D printing manufacturers.

Up to now for all tests the [3D models created by eL_maN](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3053523) were used. The result is always a combination of 3D model and printing technique - the 3D models were used as-is from thingiverse, so no customization was done to adapt to the used technique. Thus please take the results from the controller/stick tests with a heavy grain of salt. My main focus right now is to find 3D printing techniques and materials that can produce the fine gear teeth correctly. After settling on some techniques + materials later we can customize the models to fit those perfectly.
The results of all the test prints / orders are listed in the comparison table at the end.
