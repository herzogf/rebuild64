# Intro to Rebuild64
This repo's aim is to gather information on how to rebuild loose and worn analog sticks on an original (OEM) Nintendo 64 controller. Thus aftermarket / third party controllers (i.e. without any original parts) are out of scope.

I strive to repair the original stick module (bowl, gears, stick, spring) by fixing or replacing individual parts in order to maintain the original look & feel as much as possible while getting rid of all the wobbly flip-flopping from years of playing great games like Super Mario 64, Goldeneye or (behold) Mario Party.

At the moment I'm evaluating different 3D printing techniques and services to create replacement parts for my controllers, currently based on [3D models created by the genius eL_maN](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3053523). I'm  planning to find the "best" fitting (working and cost-effective) technique for production and then eventually start creating my own 3D models (got a brand new caliper :grin:).

:construction: this site is a total work in progress, draft, unfinished, mostly useless right now :smirk: doing my best to fill it with some information in the next months.

## General construction of the N64 stick module
The stick module generally consists of an outer case made of two plastic parts which holds the core components:
- bowl (white/ivory color plastic)
- 2 gears (black plastic)
- 2 optical encoder wheels (black plastic)
- stick (grey plastic)
- spring (steel)
- "separating" ring, correct name to be found :sweat_smile: (white plastic)

The interaction between the first 4 parts in the list can be seen in the great reddit post [How an N64 analog stick works](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaminggifs/comments/9hrsvc/how_an_n64_analog_stick_works/). In addition [an article by NFGworld](https://web.archive.org/web/20170107110048/https://nfgworld.com/mb/thread/447-Nintendo-s-N64-Pad-What-s-Inside) contains some nice pictures of the module's details.

As the bowl, gears and stick touch and rub on each other constantly AND are made of plastic they wear down pretty quickly. Generally those are the components you want to replace or repair to restore proper functionality.

## High level steps to rebuild a stick module

Viewed from a thousand miles high those are the basic steps to rebuild a N64 stick module:

- disassembling and cleaning
- repairing / replacing of
    - the whole module
    - [the bowl](bowl/bowl.md)
    - [the gears](gears/gears.md)
    - [the stick](stick/stick.md)
- testing
- lubricating
- reassembling

In the future each list element points to separate pages containing detailed information, but not yet :wink:

## Crosscutting concerns

Some information is relevant for bowl & gears & stick or for the rebuilding process in general:
- 3D scans and 3D models
- Additive and subtractive manufacturing (3D printing & CNC milling)
